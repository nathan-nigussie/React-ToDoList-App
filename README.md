## React + Vite
The TodoList web application has a component for
# Adding a new to-do task: 
Users can input a new task and click a button to add it to the list.
# Delete a task: 
Users can click on a delete button next to each task to remove it from the list.
# Move up or down: 
Users can click on a move-up or move-down button next to each task to change its position in the list. This allows for easy organization of tasks.
